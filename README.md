# Update CSS with JavaScript Variables

A neat little project that uses Javascript variables to override CSS properties. Use the sliders to change the background spacing and how blurry the image is. When you close on the area next to the base color, you change the background color of the image.

## Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. JavaScript
3. CSS
